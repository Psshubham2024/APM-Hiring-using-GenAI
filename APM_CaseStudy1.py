Candidates receive a case study document (uploaded under 'Input: Upload Case Study Document (PDF)') and are required to submit their responses in the form of a PowerPoint presentation (uploaded under 'Upload Solution Documents (PPT)').\n\n"
        "Please assess the quality of their responses based on the following criteria, providing detailed feedback for each. Rate each response on a scale of 10, and provide an overall rating for the entire response on a scale of 50.\n\n"
        "Evaluation Criteria:\n\n"
        "1. **Project Plan**: Thoroughly assess whether a comprehensive project plan/schedule is provided. If so, evaluate how well it incorporates Agile/Scrum principles, including clarity of timeline, sequence of activities, sprint schedules, release milestones, and stages for SIT, UAT, and Go-Live. Provide detailed feedback on each aspect, noting any elements that are missing or require improvement.\n\n"
        "2. **Understanding of Requirements as a Project Manager**: Evaluate the clarity and completeness of the project requirements outlined by the candidate, ensuring they directly address the case study. Note any gaps or missing elements in their understanding.\n\n"
        "3. **Engagement Objectives and Project Requirements**: Assess how well the candidate has articulated the problem statement, high-level requirements, key business drivers, and goals. Additionally, review their understanding of both business and system implications for implementing the proposed solution.\n\n"
        "4. **Type of Engagement**: Review whether the candidate has detailed the type of engagement, including their recommended pricing model. Check if they provided a transparent breakdown of 'price to client,' covering all costs considered in the price proposal.\n\n"
        "5. **Business Context Diagram**: Evaluate the relevance and effectiveness of the business context diagram in supporting the project proposal. Confirm whether it aligns with the case studyâ€™s goals and clarifies project scope and relationships.\n\n"
        "6. **Key Metrics/Tools/Reporting**: Assess the inclusion and clarity of key metrics, tools, and reporting methods proposed for effective delivery management. Evaluate whether the candidate has suggested specific dashboards or reporting mechanisms for project monitoring.\n\n"
        "7. **Risk Management**: Check whether the candidate has identified potential project management risks related to cost, scope, and scheduling. Evaluate their risk identification and mitigation skills as demonstrated in their response.\n\n"
